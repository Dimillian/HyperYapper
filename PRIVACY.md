# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 8, 2025**

## Overview

HyperYapper is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our social media cross-posting application.

## Information We Collect

### What We DON'T Collect
- **No Personal Data Storage**: We do not store any personal information on our servers
- **No Analytics Tracking**: We do not track your usage or behavior
- **No Third-Party Tracking**: We do not use cookies, pixels, or other tracking technologies
- **No Data Mining**: We do not analyze or process your content for any commercial purposes

### What We DO Store (Locally Only)
- **OAuth Tokens**: Social media platform access tokens are stored locally in your browser's localStorage
- **Account Information**: Basic profile information (username, display name, avatar) stored locally for UI display
- **Draft Posts**: Temporary post drafts are stored locally in your browser
- **App Settings**: User preferences and configuration stored locally

## How We Handle Your Data

### Local Storage Only
All data is stored exclusively in your browser's local storage and never transmitted to our servers. This includes:
- Social media account credentials and tokens
- Profile information from connected accounts
- Post drafts and content
- Application preferences

### Third-Party Platform Access
When you connect social media accounts:
- We use OAuth flows to securely authenticate with platforms (Twitter/X, Threads, Mastodon, BlueSky)
- Access tokens are stored locally and used only to post content on your behalf
- We only request the minimum permissions necessary for posting functionality
- We do not access, store, or process any of your existing social media content

### Data Transmission
- OAuth authentication flows occur directly between your browser and social media platforms
- Posted content is transmitted directly from your browser to the respective social media platforms
- No content passes through our servers

## Your Rights and Control

### Complete Data Control
- All your data remains on your device
- You can clear all stored data by clearing your browser's localStorage
- Disconnecting accounts removes all associated tokens and data
- Uninstalling the application removes all traces of your data

### Account Management
- You can connect and disconnect social media accounts at any time
- Disconnecting an account immediately removes all stored tokens and profile information
- No data persists after account disconnection

## Security

### Local Security
- All sensitive data (tokens, credentials) is stored in browser localStorage
- No data is transmitted over unencrypted connections
- OAuth flows use industry-standard security protocols

### Platform Security
We rely on the security measures of connected social media platforms for:
- Account authentication
- Content posting
- Token management and expiration

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy. Since we don't collect contact information, we recommend checking this policy periodically for updates.
